# Basic Overview
Basic Weather-Forecast in React. It's a quick, simple weather site. The features include the basics, including forecasts, current and Min/MAx temperature, and more. Other than that, it's really not all that complicated. It's free to download with source code.
 
It uses Geo-Location for weather report for almost all global locations. It is a nice option for the times you just need to check in on the weather to plan for your week ahead, your weekend plans or any other times when the weather could play a factor.

# API Usage
The Weather-Forecast uses the  OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather. OpenWeatherMap API is free to use for smaller-scale applications. Large applications with bigger user bases may need to opt into one of the paid plans in order to satisfy the higher call–per-minute needs. The free tier comes with the following restrictions:

 * 60 API calls per minute
 * 95% up time
 * No SSL
 * 5 day forecast is available at any location or city
 * 5 day forecast includes weather data every 3 hours
 * JSON and XML formats
 * Available for both Free and paid subscriptions
 
 If you need more calls per minute, increased up time, more frequent weather updates, or secured access, you’ll need to pay subscription. Regardless of which tier you decide to use, you need to register an API key for your application. To do this, register your application  by <a href="http://openweathermap.org/appid">signing up</a> for an account. Once logged in, you can find the key under the setup tab. Since the API is public access, the key needs to be added as a parameter to whatever API endpoint you send a request to.
